# Task: Refactor Dimensions to Object Representation

## Status
COMPLETED

## Summary
Successfully refactored dimension representation from vector arrays to object notation as per ADR-001.

## Changes Made

1. **Updated src/dimension.ts**
   - Changed `DimensionVector` to `DimensionObject` type
   - Updated all operations to work with objects
   - Kept `DimensionType` enum for backward compatibility
   - Modified `create()` to normalize objects (omit zero values)

2. **Updated scripts/extract-all-units.ts**
   - Changed to generate dimension objects instead of arrays
   - Updated type imports

3. **Regenerated src/units.ts**
   - All units now have dimension objects like `{ L: 1 }` instead of `[1,0,0,0,0,0,0]`

4. **Updated test/dimension.test.ts**
   - All tests now use object syntax
   - Added new tests for object-specific behavior
   - All 34 tests passing

5. **Updated scripts/test-dimensions.ts**
   - Updated to use object representation
   - All 18 tests passing

## Verification
- ✅ TypeScript compilation: No errors
- ✅ Unit tests: 34/34 passing
- ✅ Integration tests: 18/18 passing

## Benefits Achieved
- Much more readable code: `{ L: 1, M: 1, T: -2 }` vs `[1, 1, -2, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
- Cleaner API with no need to remember dimension order
- Smaller memory footprint (sparse representation)
- Better developer experience as intended
