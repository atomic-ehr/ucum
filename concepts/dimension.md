# Dimension

A **dimension** is an equivalence class generated by the commensurability relation. It represents the fundamental nature of a physical quantity, independent of its units or scale.

## The 7 Base Dimensions

UCUM uses seven base dimensions corresponding to the seven base units:

`[L, M, T, A, Θ, Q, F]` = powers of base units:

1. **L** - Length (meter)
2. **M** - Mass (gram)
3. **T** - Time (second)
4. **A** - Plane angle (radian)
5. **Θ** - Temperature (kelvin)
6. **Q** - Electric charge (coulomb)
7. **F** - Luminous intensity (candela)

> **Note**: UCUM differs from SI by using gram instead of kilogram, and including radian as a base unit rather than treating it as dimensionless.

## Dimension Representation

Every unit can be represented as a pair (r, û) where:
- **r** = magnitude (numeric conversion factor)
- **û** = dimension vector [L, M, T, A, Θ, Q, F] containing exponents for each base dimension

### Examples:
- `m` = `[1,0,0,0,0,0,0]` = L¹
- `N` = `[1,1,-2,0,0,0,0]` = L¹·M¹·T⁻²
- `J` = `[2,1,-2,0,0,0,0]` = L²·M¹·T⁻²
- `W` = `[2,1,-3,0,0,0,0]` = L²·M¹·T⁻³

### Common Derived Dimensions:
- Velocity: LT⁻¹
- Force: MLT⁻²
- Energy: ML²T⁻²
- Pressure: ML⁻¹T⁻²

## Dimension Algebra

### Operations on Dimensions:
- **Multiplication**: Add exponent vectors
  - `m × m = m²` → `[1,0,0,0,0,0,0] + [1,0,0,0,0,0,0] = [2,0,0,0,0,0,0]`
- **Division**: Subtract exponent vectors
  - `m / s = m/s` → `[1,0,0,0,0,0,0] - [0,0,1,0,0,0,0] = [1,0,-1,0,0,0,0]`
- **Exponentiation**: Multiply exponents by the power
  - `m³` → `[1,0,0,0,0,0,0] × 3 = [3,0,0,0,0,0,0]`

## Commensurability

Units are **commensurable** (convertible) if and only if they have the same dimension:
- `m` and `ft` both = `[1,0,0,0,0,0,0]` ✓ (convertible)
- `m` and `kg` have different dimensions ✗ (not convertible)

## Special Cases

### Dimensionless Units
- Units like percent, parts per million, and (in UCUM) radian
- Have dimension vector `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`
- All dimensionless units are commensurable with each other

### Special Units
- Units on non-ratio scales (e.g., Celsius, pH)
- Cannot participate in algebraic operations
- Handled differently from regular units

### Arbitrary Units
- Have no specific dimension
- Not commensurable with any other unit
- Cannot be converted (e.g., enzyme activity units)

## Implementation Notes

- Most practical units use exponents from -4 to +4
- Memory-limited implementations can use 4 bits per dimension vector component
- Dimension vectors depend on base system choice and ordering

**Key insight**: The dimension system forms the mathematical foundation that enables UCUM to determine unit compatibility, perform conversions, and maintain semantic consistency across the entire unit system.
